## Project Description:
In this project, we set an eye on Toronto, a city that has demonstrated 78 homicides, 373 shootings, and 5,268 breaks and enters in 2021 till December 2nd (Toronto Crime Incidences, 2021), highlighting the necessity of police patrol for
crime prevention and improving citizensâ€™ feeling of safety. Based on a simplified simulation of the Toronto police system and public safety conditions, we built a model to minimize the budget spent on police patrolling
among divisions in downtown Toronto via optimizing the patrolling routes and determining the number of police cars.
