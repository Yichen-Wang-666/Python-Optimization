### Project Description
In the retailer game, each round starts with 2000 items and the sales season is 15 weeks.
One needs to choose their strategy during the 15 weeks sale time. One has 4 possible
strategy: $60, $54, $48 and $36. Each time after the price decreases, one cannot choose to
increase the price. For example, if at week 6 one changes the sale price from $60 to $54,
they cannot change back to $60 anymore. The only options left are to maintain the price at
$54, or decrease the price further to $48 or $36.

In this assignment, we aimed to develop a strategy to achieve a good performance in the
retail markdown game under different random circumstances.
